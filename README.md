# NYC motor vehicle collison analysis 
~worst location and weather~

In New York City, more than 200,000 motor vehicle collisions happens every year.
This means about every 3min, a collision happen somewhere in NYC. To reduce collisions, we need to find targets to improve.
I used NYC collision data and historical weather data to find the worst location (total number of collisions) and worst weather condition (frequency of collsion). Further I developed new method to investigate locations where are sensitive to certain weather condition.

## Collision Data: NYC Opendata (https://data.cityofnewyork.us)
## Weather Data: Weather Underground (www.wunderground.com)
